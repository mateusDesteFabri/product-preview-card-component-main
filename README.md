## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I made this project by following Kevin Powell's tutorial. Making it I learned:

- How to approach a project thinking mobile-first
- BEM methodology for CSS
- CSS reset
- How to use CSS custom properties for setting colors, typography
- Utility classes
- CSS Grid and Flexbox
- How and when to use relative units like **em** and **rem**
- How to improve application readability
- Add extra context for accessibility reasons

### Continued development

More about how to create layouts using Flexbox and Grid. Responsiveness, media queries, how to organize the code to make it clean, reusable and maintainable are also some of my aims.
